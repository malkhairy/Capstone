## The research question:

The objective of this research is to forecast adherence among individuals diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and/or Heart failure. This will be achieved by constructing a predictive model utilizing electronic medical records.


## Data 
Data was collected and deindetified from medical institution - IRB approved


## Techniques
Following technicques were used:
    1- EDA
    2- Feature engineering to prepare data.
    3- Various Regression and Classifier algorithms such as:
          -Knearest Neighbor
          -Decision Tree
          -Logistic Regression
          -SVM

We used accuaracy for training and test sets as evaluation metrics and ROC curves



## Results
Based on accuracy on the validation set, Tree model outperformed all other models.
